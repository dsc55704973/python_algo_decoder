# Pythonic Text File Decoder
## # python_algo_decoder
### A simple pythonic algorithm to decode an unstructured, randomized text file (a simple exercise in intelligence)

### Quick Summary
Thank you for reviewing this simple bit of code that I recently submitted as part of a technical exam.  The task was to decode a message from a randomized, unstructred text file containing labeled pairs (an integer and a string). The key to decoding this mysterious message is to read the last word from three consecutive layers of the data after it has been restructed as a pyramid.

### Structure of Pyramid:
[1]

[2,3]

[4,5,6]

[7,8,9,10] 

...

### Format of Text File to Decode:
1 top
2 of
3 secret
4 power
5 excite
6 message
7 dog
8 opposite
9 oxygen
10 whole
...

### Output
** The algorithm, when set to parameters [1,3,6], will output:

#### ['top','secret','message']

### Method
The steps taken to leverage python to execute the decodification of this message are as follows:

#### Step 1: TXT OBJECT CONVERSION
First step is to 

#### Step 2: BUILD THE PYRAMID


#### Step 3: DECODE THE MESSAGE ('TOP SECRET MESSAGE')
